    <h1>Jack K Report:</h1>
    <h2>Client Report</h2>
    <p>I chose images based on what I needed for my site it was a video game console ranking so I just needed images and information about that.</p>
    <p>No issues in communication checked in with me to show me the progress</p>
    <p>I loved the website exactly what I wanted the only problem is one of the child pages didn't get done</p>
    <p>Next time I am going to communicate a bit more to get everything done.</p>

    <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
    <p>I sent them the links I probably should have comunicated better</p>
    <p>I honestly didn't really communicate I just followed the site plan next time I will check in better</p>
    <p>Publishing and sharing it wasn't a problem</p>
    <p>I've used Github before so using and navigating it wasn't a problem</p>

    <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
    <p>No issues communicating</p>
    <p> Yes the site plan was laid out well for both sites</p>
    <p>Yep finished child pages for each lead developer</p>
    <p>No issues adding to GitHub</p>

    <h2>General Experience and Relfections</h2>
    <p>The most challenging part was the css and html as lead becasuse you must format it right for the junior developers to easily use. I was able to overcome it, it just took a while to add the id's and class's</p>
    <p>I liked the part of working in a team I thought that was interesting and I liked being lead developer</p>
    <p>I would communicate better with my junior developers and client so we can make the best websitea and make sure the client is happy.</p>
    <p>I feel way more confident after working on this project. I feel like I gained a bunch of important skills in website development the only thing I would need to improve on is making it look good for different sizes of screens.</p>
