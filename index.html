            <h1>What Is A Game Jam?</h1>
            <p>Game Jams are timed events in which a team of game developers work together and collaborate to create small, polished games. A game jam can take as long as a couple months or be as short as a couple of hours, within this time many different individuals or teams compete to make the best game. Only two things remain consistent between game jams, every game jam has a time limit and a theme to direct creative design. Inside each person’s game there is much to be considered, games are typically graded on sound design/music, artistic visuals and effects, gameplay ingenuity, how fun the finished product is and how well the game fits the theme.</p>
